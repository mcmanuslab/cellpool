This repository contains the code for the manuscript entitled "Scalable imaging-based profiling of CRISPR perturbations with protein barcodes" by Krishna Choudhary and Michael McManus. 

To reproduce figures in the manuscript, download the cellPool Docker container from `docker://krriisshhna/cellpool:latest` or build using the Docker file in the cellPool folder here. Then, edit the paths for raw data and output directories in the `00.config/config.json` folder. Finally, run the .nf files in the numerical order following the Nextflow commands, e.g.,

```
docker pull docker://krriisshhna/cellpool:latest
nextflow run 10.maxproj_and_vigcorr.nf -with-singularity cellpool.sif -params-file 00.config/config.json
```

See [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) for more parameter options.
